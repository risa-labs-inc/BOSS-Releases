## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Application Security

#### Code Signing
- All BOSS releases are digitally signed
- **macOS**: Apple Developer ID certificate
- **Windows**: Authenticode certificate with timestamping
- **Verification**: Users can verify signatures before installation

#### Secure Distribution
- All releases distributed through official channels only
- Checksums provided for integrity verification
- Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies

#### Runtime Security
- **Sandboxing**: Application runs with minimal required privileges
- **Memory Protection**: Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
- **Buffer Overflow Protection**: Stack canaries and DEP enabled
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs

### Data Security

#### Encryption at Rest
- **Configuration Files**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive settings
- **Cache Data**: Encrypted local storage for temporary data
- **Credentials**: Secure credential storage using platform keychains
  - macOS: Keychain Services
  - Windows: Windows Credential Manager
  - Linux: Secret Service API

#### Encryption in Transit
- **TLS 1.3**: All network communications use modern TLS
- **Certificate Pinning**: Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral key exchange

#### Data Minimization
- Only necessary data is collected and stored
- Regular purging of temporary and cached data
- No telemetry without explicit user consent

### Network Security

#### LLM/AI Integration Security
- **API Key Protection**: Secure storage and transmission of API keys
- **Request Sanitization**: Input validation for AI prompts
- **Response Filtering**: Output sanitization from AI services
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against API abuse

#### RPA Engine Security
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Browser automation in isolated environment
- **Permission Model**: Granular control over automated actions
- **Action Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for RPA activities
- **Security Headers**: Implementation of CSP and other security headers

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Internal Security Practices
- **Static Code Analysis**: Automated scanning with every build
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular audits of third-party libraries
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly security assessments
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused review process

### External Security Audits
- Annual third-party security audits
- Responsible disclosure program
- Bug bounty program (contact for details)

## 🏥 Healthcare Security Compliance

Given BOSS's healthcare focus, we maintain additional security standards:

### HIPAA Considerations
- **Data Handling**: Designed to support HIPAA-compliant workflows
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access to sensitive information
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for compliance requirements
- **Encryption**: HIPAA-level encryption standards

### Additional Healthcare Standards
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Compliance framework adherence
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Implementation guidelines
- **Healthcare Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST)**: Security controls

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Recommended Security Settings

#### Installation Security
```bash
# Verify downloaded file integrity (example for macOS)
shasum -a 256 BOSS-8.10.1-Universal.dmg

# Expected checksum will be provided with release
```

#### Runtime Security Configuration
1. **Enable Auto-Updates**: Ensure timely security patches
2. **Configure Firewall**: Allow only necessary network access
3. **Regular Backups**: Secure backup of configuration and data
4. **Access Controls**: Use strong authentication for sensitive operations

### Security Hardening Guidelines
- Run BOSS with standard user privileges (avoid admin/root)
- Regularly update operating system and dependencies
- Use endpoint protection software
- Monitor system logs for unusual activity
